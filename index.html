    <h1>A Word of Welcome</h1>
    ☘
    <p>I cut an old leaf from my house plant. Is that actually caring? Should I not just let it grow yellow? From the phenomenon of houseplants, I got fascinated by how they seduce me into a kind of care where I try to control their growth. Does the plant even want to be bigger?  
    <br><br>I recognise this tendency to give shape, from making something or helping someone, but it seems <a href="#" name="Creating a dependency relation that limits the object of care and sets the caring subject up with an unfair and unrealistic task of deciding for others.">unhelpful</a>.
    I'm looking for ways of acting that respect the agency outside myself, without 'careful' turning into inertia (which is rather careless). 
    How to care in a trustful way?
    </p>
    <h2>Care Design</h2>
    <p>Specifically, I'm looking for what material conditions invite such a trustful care-relation. I'm starting from the idea that care is often designed. Human plant-care is a relation that is mediated by tools, images, or concepts. These 'technologies' not only reflect ideas of how humans relate to plants, but also shape and reproduce them.</p>
    <p>Here, I want to get a better sense of how design choices affect relations of care. Both how they may invite a control-based relation, but in the end to explore:
    <br><br><em>How to design a plant-care relation based on trust?</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering method</h2>
    <p>  
    On this site I collect cases where <a href="#" name="Here, any kind of thing given shape with humans involved">design</a> structures the care relation between humans and plants. 
    I look for relations where humans do engage with plants – <strong>care</strong> rather than <strong>neglect</strong> – but where plants have agency over how they grow – <strong>trust</strong> rather than <strong>control</strong>. 
    <br><br> This creates four quadrants. Bottom-left is the Easy Dystopia of full control that isolates us from engagement with plants. Bottom-right is the Hard Dystopia of much care but in a controlling shape that will reproduce the inequalities and vulnerabilities of today. Top-left is an Unexpected Ally; although care is far off, it does teach me ways of letting go. Top-right is my Utopia of trustful ways of caring.
    <br><br> 
    I group these instances into different disciplines of 'design'. So far there are the following layers:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
      <li>Giving, Holding, Taking. (graphic design)</li>
      <li>Garden Arrangements. (landscape design)</li>
      <li>The House-Plant-House. (architecture)</li>
      <li>Views of Nature. (cultural concepts)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Based on gathering many of such instances and my subjective reflections on them, I hope to find patterns. Patterns between these design disciplines that may teach me some literacy in what design choices and aesthetics to avoid, and mostly, what are design tactics to invite trustful care.
    </p>  
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
    I see this site as a Gathering stage of a larger, self-initiated, artistic research project that will be complemented by a positioning Report and Proposals for alternative designs. The shape of these will depend on what I'll find here. 
    <br><br>

      <h2>Zen Grip</h2>
      <p>I admire the care necessary to create a bonsai, but the aesthetic bothers me in its unbothering, uptight cleanliness.</p>
      <p>It's not because I wouldn't want to sit in that patch of grass over there. I do want to lay down, spread my arms and oh watch out I don't disturb the raked gravel waves. But I don't want to let myself indulge. The seduction feels escapist, and ultimately, lonely.</p>
      <p>Precision is intense engagement plus strong grip. There is listening – paths responding to rocks – but any green is kept neat within the lines.</p>

      <h2>Victory</h2>
      <p>In a Victorian garden, design has won and everything blooms.</p>
      <p>There is an honesty to the artificiality, and a vulnerability to the idealised expression of hills and flowerfields. At least I feel some resonance with the romantic painting.</p>
      <p>The blooming is a feat, a brushstroke that keeps on asking. A tableau vivant that is codependent on the flowers growing. But where they grow and from where they are watched is set with a subtle fence. </p>

      <p>In the Eden of the Teletubbies, nature is a set, a virtual background for soft drama to play out.</p>
      <p>The hilled fields need to be as spotless as a greenscreen, or they would foreground themselves, breaking the illusion that the set is not real.</p>
      <p>The grass is controlled to the extent that it could have been fake, so far away the smells and dirt. Televised, literally 'seen from afar'.</p>

      <h2>Growing Carpet</h2>
      <p>Persian carpets mirror garden plans, but mostly as a map or a screenshot. Within the actual garden, the lines drawn are just the stage on which blooming can happen.</p>
      <p>There's a combination between functionality with irrigation channels, and symmetry, a kind of technical aesthetics. Landscape seems far away.</p>
      <p>The edges are more rough than the Victorian garden, fat brick marked fields of slight (if often homogenous) chaos.</p>

      <h2>Personal Jungle</h2>
      <p>There is the fantasy of creating the jungle. Of building an arrangement of plants wild enough to create a sense of surprise.</p>
      <p>I think it's close to my ideal garden. Of course its planted at first, but it only fully gets there when it grows beyond the plan.</p>
      <p>It may look effortless but my first concern would be keeping the plants alive. I realise that I presume that it would exist in the Netherlands. If so, it could only ever exist as a well-tended vignette.</p>
      <p>But let me choose to imagine it in Sicily. Less control, less care?</p>

      <p>Some Wise Man might have said, if you want to assert your will over the world, first clean your lawn.</p>
      <p>A blank slate, but also a place to host. BBQ, badminton, somersaults, a private camping, an outdoor green-carpetted room.</p>
      <p>It sucks water and spits sprouts, turns yellow and melts into mud. A flat-laid weather report. It's just that when work is done, laying down, bare feet through the leaves, that distance dissolves.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Return</h2>
      <p>The small gardens around Medieval English cottages functioned first to feed the appetite of their caretakers. Later they fulfilled the romantic aesthetic longing of a return to nature. They became an #aesthetic.</p> 
      <p>Opposed to the imposed 'carpet bedding' order of Victorian gardens, cottage style offered informality and density. It's Romantic and Arts & Crafts – just like cottagecore.</p>
      <p>Cottage gardens capture a design paradox. How to make something wild? Natural even? Mixing plants helps give a 'casual' feel.</p>
      <p>One famous follower of the trend was Claude Monet with his Giverny garden, and that's how it turned back into art.</p>

      <p>Through the Moon Gate, a Borrowed View, a pond with Mandarin Ducks and a Scholar Stone. Things are named, which suggests things are placed.</p>
      <p>The Chinese garden felt chaotic to westeners. There is no overview, you only see parts at a time. Still these views are carefully crafted.</p>
      <p>The kind of craft is specific though. It's not so much based on creation, but more on curation. Using found 'scholar' stones, borrowing views from outside the garden, embedding seasonal fragrants into the design and names of pavilions.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Vacant Lot</h2>
      <p>Construction sites often turn into unintended scenes of urban rewilding. In between concrete slabs and drainage pipes, a blossoming bouquet of plants usually considered weeds.</p>
      <p>This was the model and aesthetic for The New Garden of the Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam. As far as design goes, Hans Engelbrecht and Frank Bruggeman introduced some building materials and sand heaps in 2015, and plants did the rest.</p> 
      <p>In a few years, the garden was filled with a wild range of plants. So wild it invited illicit encounters between those who dwell well when hidden from sight. Reason enough for the municipality to start weeding out.

      <h2>Garden as Jungle</h2>
      <p>Local subtropical species in wild beds with original Florida sand. This is getting close to the Hockney painting. An original personal paradise by Raymond Jungles.</p>
      <p>Perhaps to increase the perception of wilderness by contrast, Raymond introduced some concrete monoliths. They work for me. Especially with that soft crisp sand.</p> 
      <p>The Casa Morada is a luxury hotel. Perhaps it says something about the personal jungle dream. It's not very affordable to have a worry-free jungle experience. The best service remains invisible.

      <h2>Garden as Mushroom</h2>
      <p>When the Planergruppe designed the landscape of a derrilict old coal mine, they must have already found a landscape of post-industrial plants.</p>
      <p>Zollverein was once Europe largest coal mine. Like other sites at the end of the industrial world, things grow. The Planergruppe tried to keep much of that, but added paths for humans to re-enter.</p> 
      <p>There's something about the geometric paths following the old train tracks that I like. Honest, literally juxtaposing wildflowers and pedestrians. I just don't know if all insects can cross the conrete slabs.

    <h1>I. Giving, holding, taking</h1>
    <p>A collection of icons and logos that show a certain connection between humans and plants.</p>
    <p>I think that many of them are meant to communicate a caring relationship, although there are also icons that rather seem to communicate distance or powerlessness, at least to me.</p>
    <p>Still, a caring or engaged relation can sometimes also be a controlling one. The hand that supports may also limit how the plant can move.</p>
    <p>In the end I'm looking for aesthetics that suggest (and through it, make) a caring but trusting relationship between humans and plans.</p>
    <h2>Care lessons</h2>
    <p>Learning from the logos that gives me a few things to keep in mind:
    <ol>
      <li>Even when then hands are on a distance, they can still feel caring, a safety net against gravity.
      <img src="/images/icons/floatplant.png"/>

        <img src="/images/icons/nihilism.png" class="white"/>
      </li>
      <li>Most icons, even the trustier ones, still stick to a convention to enlarge the human hands to about the size of the earth. Hidden anthropocentricism?

      <p>Empty as this is as clean as a Tugendhill house in a Tati film. Perhaps it also feels ready to put a desk in because of the absence of greenery. It must have been kept well to ward of molds and lichens attracted by the moist of a building left to its own. Care as a silent killer.</p>

      <p>Any care practiced at the front garden is infused with biopower's self-surveillance. What will the neighbours think? And, importantly, what will I allow the neighbours to see, both in front of the window and behind?</p>
      <p>I want one. I'll have to deal with these incentives to control it. But I'll gladly take up the care.</p>

      <h2>Beautiful Nature</h2>
      <p>The tulip is the product of an idea of nature as a source of beauty. The Tulip bulb crash in the seventeenth century was a reminder that beauty does not always last.</p>
      <p>I think that beauty as a lens aligns with Morton's Authentic Style of thinking ecology. This centers the experience of nature, the unmediated access to its wilderness.</p>
      <p>There's a funny tension when this wilderness is cultivated in machinated landscapes. It's almost smart. But it doesn't acknowledge that nature described is always tamed, and that the describer is never innocent. 'Authenticity' kills the drama. It misses how being ecological has to include your perspective.</p>

      <p>We're always already nature. Everything is connected, like the mycelium 'internet of the forest' and all the critical text that use the metaphor of this 'rhizome' to explain that everything is connected.</p>
      <p>This links with a style of thinking that Morton wishes to see. One that goes beyond fatalism, because that's too soon as long as we can even consider it a choice, as long as I am here thinking and writing.</p>

      <p>In a functional idea of nature, all non-human organisms are there primarily as a potential resource. (Still running through a cornfield feels romantic.)</p>

      <h2>Wild Nature</h2>
      <p>Nature as wild and untamed, in opposition to human artifice, and most importantly, way bigger and sublime. This view feels like it deifies nature but negates humans, as if we're not a part of it, only through being blown away by it.</p>
      <p>Part of this echoes in romantic writing, but when done well this would not fall under Morton's Authentic Style. And even when done well, there is a risk of falling into the Religious Style.</p>
      <p>Sublime nature may suddenly elevate your experience so much that you start looking down on the fallible and godless creatures that are your fellow humans. Misanthropocentrism, Morton calls it.</p>

      <h2>Cultured Nature</h2>
      <p>Growing up in the Netherlands may have made me default to a view of nature as something made, or at least 'kept'. The human in the role of the steward, taking care of nature as of a garden the size of the planet. I'm not sure again, it feels hierarchical, too comfortable to assume the position of the one giving rather than needing care.</p>
      <p>Here we find an ecology in Morton's Immersive Style. Nature as a thing to surround ourselves with, still presumes that we aren't already.</p>
      <p>Morton notes how many ways of talking about the environment seem anchored in the idea of a settlement or house. This fixed location is from where nature seems to happen 'around'. Think 'surroundings', 'en-viron', 'ambi-ence'. There may be care but no trust</p>

    <h1>Styles of Relating</h1>
    <p>A collection of ways of understanding what 'nature' means. It is based on views of nature that have been popular in Western culture. It also aligns very closely with Timothy Morton's distinction of different styles of thinking about ecology.</p>
    <p>An Immersive Style pictures an 'environment' around but outside oneself. An Authentic style aims for unmediated experience, but forgets the gaze. A Religious style acknowledges how things are complicit, but not itself. An Efficient style aims for smooth operations but forgets what is smoothened out.</p>
    <p>I'm looking for a way or style of thinking 'nature' that starts from acknowledging how we are intertwined, but that still leaves space for humans (because I am one).</p>

      <p>In the Blue Marble, Earth is not only presented as vulnerable (to some it's like looking back from afar and feeling homesick), but also as holdable. As finite. As potential territory.</p>

      <p>From the platonic idea of an ideal realm hovering over those of the senses to a hesitation to engage with the market. Vile and corrupted, that there. Unlike me here.</p>
      <p>Strong engagement, but strong distance. Even though the danger is too strong for the vile to be contained so neatly, the desire is pure.</p>

      <p>Akin to the ambitions of Morton's Authentic nature writers, there's a peace in finding ways to attune to the experience of the world, or what Macy calls "erotic affirmation of the world of phenomena".</p>
      <p>Perversion may not be strange but maybe when unacknowledged. When eroticism ignites exoticism, others the world, the pleasure becomes consumptive.</p>

      <h2>World as Self</h2>
      <p>"We are the world knowing itself" (Macy).</p>
      <p>What I find hard with such affirmations of oneness and intrinsic connectedness and all is that they can start to feel meaningless really quickly. Sure ontologically yes, but so what?</p>
      <p>Macy does appreciate difference, noting "we don’t have to surrender our individuality to experience the world as an extended self and its story as our own extended story."</p>
      <p>That's why a selfie from space is not necessarily just affirming difference, or separation, I think. It also suggests, through image-rhyme, a connection. Do you see the similarity? The kinship?</p>

      <p>Still, porous as they seem, plant pots perform a very deep intervention. They isolate a plant from its environment, rendering it as an individual. Divorced from the culture it inhabited, it has to reroot in a different place, perhaps even the pot, placed in a white-walled rectangular space.</p>

      <p>Giving your plants their vitamin dose, the minerals they need to grow. It seems a classic caretaking gesture. The problem is not in the fertilising (at least when done organically).</p>
      <p>You can only fertilise what is otherwise infertile. And things aren't so much infertile as made infertile, depleted. Usually it seems there would be a 'natural circle of life' that would enrich the soil with the recomposed corpses of the past generation.</p>

      <p>Bio Kill seems an easy enemy, but it is apparently specifically focused, on ants. Does that make it different from weeding?</p>
      <p>Yes, where some plants-made-weeds may actually compete with other 'wanted' plants, ants don't. The Bio Kill approach seems to be more about isolating a plant from ecology.</p>
