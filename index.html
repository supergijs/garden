<!-- WORD OF WELCOME -->
<div id="gijsgarden" class="overlay labeldef">

  <div>
    <h1>A Word of Welcome</h1>
    ☘
    <p>I cut an old leaf off my house plant. Is that actually caring? Should I not just let it grow yellow? I got fascinated by how house plants seduce me into a kind of care where I try to control their growth. Does the plant even want to be bigger?  
    <br><br>I recognise this desire to shape from when I'm making something or helping someone, but it seems <a href="#" name="Creating a dependency relation that limits the object of care and sets the caring subject up with an unfair and unrealistic task of deciding for others.">unhelpful</a>.
    I'm looking for ways of acting that respect the agency outside myself, without 'careful' turning into inertia (which is rather careless). 
    How to care in a trustful way?
    </p>
    <h2>Care Design</h2>
    <p>In this garden I'm looking for what material conditions invite such a trustful care-relation. I'm starting from the idea that care relations never grow by themselves. Human plant-care is a relation that is mediated by tools, images, or concepts. These 'technologies' not only reflect ideas of how humans relate to plants, but also structure and reproduce them.</p>
    <p>Here, I want to get a better sense of how design choices affect relations of care. How they nurture the status quo by inviting a control-based relations, and to explore:
    <br><br><em>How to design a plant-care relation based on trust?</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering method</h2>
    <p>  
    On this site I collect cases where <a href="#" name="Here, any kind of thing given shape with humans involved">design</a> structures the care relation between humans and plants. 
    I look for relations where humans do engage with plants – <strong>care</strong> rather than <strong>neglect</strong> – but where plants have agency over how they grow – <strong>trust</strong> rather than <strong>control</strong>. 
    <br><br> 
    This creates four quadrants. Bottom-left is the Clear Dystopia of full control that isolates us from engagement with plants. Bottom-right is the Hidden Dystopia of much care but in a controlling shape that will reproduce the inequalities and vulnerabilities of today. Top-left is an Unexpected Ally; although care is far off, it does teach me ways of letting go. Top-right is my Uncunny Utopia of trustful ways of caring.
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/powertools/routecompass.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
    <br><br>
    I group these instances into different disciplines of 'design', see the guide on the left. So far there are the following layers:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Garden Arrangements. (landscape design)</li>
      <li>Giving, Holding, Taking. (graphic design)</li>
      <li>The House-Plant-House. (architecture)</li>
      <li>Views of Nature. (cultural concepts)</li>
      <li>Human Responsibility. (ethics)</li>
      <li>Earth Images. (photography)</li>
      <li>Care Tools. (product design)</li>
      <li>House Plants. (botany)</li>
      <li>Post-Growth Futures. (futuring)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Based on gathering many instances and my subjective reflections on them, I hope to find patterns. Patterns between these design disciplines that may teach me some literacy in what design choices and aesthetics to avoid, and mostly, what are design tactics to invite trustful care.
    </p>  
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
    I started this site as a Gathering stage of a larger self-initiated artistic research project that would be complemented by a positioning Essay and potentially Proposals for alternative designs. 
    <br><br>
    The <a href="#powertools">essay</a> took shape as a contribution to Robida Magazine (click to read). Besides it lead to a <a href="#futuresinfo">viusal essay</a> contribution to a think tank on post-growth futures of Stichting Toekomstbeeld der Technologie. Both are featured on this garden-site under 'Thoughts' to the left. It also leaked into a project I did with Vera van der Burg on self-training AI as a reflexive mirror called <a href="https://supergijs.com/#objectportrait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Objective Portrait</a>.

      <h2>Zen Grip</h2>
      <p>I admire the care necessary to create a bonsai, but the aesthetic bothers me in its unbothering, uptight cleanliness.</p>
      <p>It's not because I wouldn't want to sit in that patch of grass over there. I do want to lay down, spread my arms and oh watch out I don't disturb the raked gravel waves. But I don't want to let myself indulge. The seduction feels escapist, and ultimately, lonely.</p>
      <p>Precision is intense engagement plus strong grip. There is listening – paths responding to rocks – but any green is kept neat within the lines.</p>

      <h2>Victory</h2>
      <p>In a Victorian garden, design has won and everything blooms.</p>
      <p>There is an honesty to the artificiality, and a vulnerability to the idealised expression of hills and flowerfields. At least I feel some resonance with the romantic painting.</p>
      <p>The blooming is a feat, a brushstroke that keeps on asking. A tableau vivant that is codependent on the flowers growing. But where they grow and from where they are watched is set with a subtle fence. </p>

      <p>In this Dutch labyrinth it's harder to find wilderness than the exit.</p>
      <p>Plants have a functional role here, and care is reduced to maintaining a homogenous hedge that you can't see through.</p>
      <p>Control is key. The disorientation only works when there are no contingencies to discover.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Set</h2>
      <p>In the Eden of the Teletubbies, nature is a set, a virtual background for soft drama to play out.</p>
      <p>The hilled fields need to be as spotless as a greenscreen, or they would foreground themselves, breaking the illusion that the set is not real.</p>
      <p>The grass is controlled to the extent that it could have been fake, so far away the smells and dirt. Televised, literally 'seen from afar'.</p>

      <p>No lawn greener than a golf course in the desert.</p>
      <p>There are allusions to landscape: hills, sand dunes, patches of trees. But there's no illusion made.</p>
      <p>The grass is a sports pitch, a rolled out augmented reality mat for games and anonymous meetings.</p>

      <h2>Growing Carpet</h2>
      <p>Persian carpets mirror garden plans, but mostly as a map or a screenshot. Within the actual garden, the lines drawn are just the stage on which blooming can happen.</p>
      <p>There's a combination between functionality with irrigation channels, and symmetry, a kind of technical aesthetics. Landscape seems far away.</p>
      <p>The edges are more rough than the Victorian garden, fat brick marked fields of slight (if often homogenous) chaos.</p>

      <h2>Personal Jungle</h2>
      <p>There is the fantasy of creating the jungle. Of building an arrangement of plants wild enough to create a sense of surprise.</p>
      <p>I think it's close to my ideal garden. Of course its planted at first, but it only fully gets there when it grows beyond the plan.</p>
      <p>It may look effortless but my first concern would be keeping the plants alive. I realise that I presume that it would exist in the Netherlands. If so, it could only ever exist as a well-tended vignette.</p>
      <p>But let me choose to imagine it in Sicily. Less control, less care?</p>

      <p>Some Wise Man might have said, if you want to assert your will over the world, first clean your lawn.</p>
      <p>A blank slate, but also a place to host. BBQ, badminton, somersaults, a private camping, an outdoor green-carpetted room.</p>
      <p>It sucks water and spits sprouts, turns yellow and melts into mud. A flat-laid weather report. It's just that when work is done, laying down, bare feet through the leaves, that distance dissolves.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Return</h2>
      <p>The small gardens around Medieval English cottages functioned first to feed the appetite of their caretakers. Later they fulfilled the romantic aesthetic longing of a return to nature. They became an #aesthetic.</p> 
      <p>Opposed to the imposed 'carpet bedding' order of Victorian gardens, cottage style offered informality and density. It's Romantic and Arts & Crafts – just like cottagecore.</p>
      <p>Cottage gardens capture a design paradox. How to make something wild? Natural even? Mixing plants helps give a 'casual' feel.</p>
      <p>One famous follower of the trend was Claude Monet with his Giverny garden, and that's how it turned back into art.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Film</h2>
      <p>Through the Moon Gate, a Borrowed View, a pond with Mandarin Ducks and a Scholar Stone. Things are named, which suggests things are placed.</p>
      <p>The Chinese garden felt chaotic to westeners. There is no overview, you only see parts at a time. Still these views are carefully crafted.</p>
      <p>The kind of craft is specific though. It's not so much based on creation, but more on curation. Using found 'scholar' stones, borrowing views from outside the garden, embedding seasonal fragrants into the design and names of pavilions.</p>

      <h2>Garden as Vacant Lot</h2>
      <p>Construction sites often turn into unintended scenes of urban rewilding. In between concrete slabs and drainage pipes, a blossoming bouquet of plants usually considered weeds.</p>
      <p>This was the model and aesthetic for The New Garden of the Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam. As far as design goes, Hans Engelbrecht and Frank Bruggeman introduced some building materials and sand heaps in 2015, and plants did the rest.</p> 
      <p>In a few years, the garden was filled with a wild range of plants. So wild it invited illicit encounters between those who dwell well when hidden from sight. Reason enough for the municipality to start weeding out.

      <h2>Garden as Jungle</h2>
      <p>Local subtropical species in wild beds with original Florida sand. This is getting close to the Hockney painting. An original personal paradise by Raymond Jungles.</p>
      <p>Perhaps to increase the perception of wilderness by contrast, Raymond introduced some concrete monoliths. They work for me. Especially with that soft crisp sand.</p> 
      <p>The Casa Morada is a luxury hotel. Perhaps it says something about the personal jungle dream. It's not very affordable to have a worry-free jungle experience. The best service remains invisible.

      <h2>Garden as Mushroom</h2>
      <p>When the Planergruppe designed the landscape of a derrilict old coal mine, they must have already found a landscape of post-industrial plants.</p>
      <p>Zollverein was once Europe largest coal mine. Like other sites at the end of the industrial world, things grow. The Planergruppe tried to keep much of that, but added paths for humans to re-enter.</p> 
      <p>There's something about the geometric paths following the old train tracks that I like. Honest, literally juxtaposing wildflowers and pedestrians. I just don't know if all insects can cross the conrete slabs.

      <p>Shekvetili Dendrological Park realises a millionaire's dream of a zoo of elderly trees. Floated in from all around the world to this final resting spot.</p> 
      <p>The mode of care invited exists in the register of wonder, and in the template of the hero's journey. As if it doesn't take a village to raise one, keep one alive, and be its object of protection. Will the hometown hero ever return? </p>

      <p>Holding a plant in transit in between two places where it can live or on its way to the bin.</p>
      <p>The engagement is strong, skin to soil, wood to flesh even, but so is the hierarchy. The livelihood of the plant resting on the palm of your hand.</p>
      <p>I just feel a slice of doubt when looking at the wrist, which makes the hand look less like something that controls than something cut off.</p>

      <p>So, while nature is presented, it feels distant, represented as a self-sustaining system best left on its own.</p>
      <p>There's a trust in that, sure, but it feels like we're off the hook a little too easily, under the guise of being very concerned with the matter.</p>

      <p>I shouldn't get too biased by the sympathy of the company. Sure this looks like a warm hug by a fiery fox. But both fox and earth are not carethings here.</p>
      <p>First, I shouldn't identify myself with the fox. Sure the fox would guide me through the World Wide Web, but it's not me. Apart from hugging it's also just territorially fencing off its play ball (way to small for an earth really).</p>

    <h1>Giving, holding, taking</h1>
    <p>A collection of icons and logos that show a certain connection between humans and plants.</p>
    <p>I think that many of them are meant to communicate a caring relationship, although there are also icons that rather seem to communicate distance or powerlessness, at least to me.</p>
    <p>Still, a caring or engaged relation can sometimes also be a controlling one. The hand that supports may also limit how the plant can move.</p>
    <p>In the end I'm looking for aesthetics that suggest (and through it, make) a caring but trusting relationship between humans and plans.</p>
    <h2>Care lessons</h2>
    <p>Learning from the logos that gives me a few things to keep in mind:
    <ol>
      <li>Even when then hands are on a distance, they can still feel caring, a safety net against gravity.
      <img src="/images/icons/floatplant.png"/>
      </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find I can learn something from the nihilistic, namely distance. Does trust imply distance? When is a distance still a relation?
        <img src="/images/icons/nihilism.png" class="white"/>
      </li>
      <li>Most icons, even the trustier ones, still stick to a convention to enlarge the human hands to about the size of the earth. Hidden anthropocentricism?

      <p>It looks relatively wild, compared to a usual house plant setup. Still, I don't fully trust it. Its perceived wilderness is probably enhanced by being framed in a meticulously ordered environment. It's contained.</p>

      <p>An empty loft feels extra empty after we moved on from pre-Victorian houses without plants. Some plants would compensate the negative emptiness.</p>
      <p>That may be a general rule, because this space – especially in this place – feels very lonely. I think this loneliness is also luring, but not as much as with a few plants.</p>
      <p>Empty as this is as clean as a Tugendhill house in a Tati film. Perhaps it also feels ready to put a desk in because of the absence of greenery. It must have been kept well to ward of molds and lichens attracted by the moist of a building left to its own. Care as a silent killer.</p>

      <p>Unlike curtains, these plants are not to look through only, even though they also frame the view.They sit and hang waterable, on arm-length distance.</p>
      <p>Within bounds, within arrangements, within there frame, there's space to hang and tangle. It's a staged play but a play indeed.</p>

      <h2>Beautiful Nature</h2>
      <p>The tulip is the product of an idea of nature as a source of beauty. The Tulip bulb crash in the seventeenth century was a reminder that beauty does not always last.</p>
      <p>I think that beauty as a lens aligns with Morton's Authentic Style of thinking ecology. This centers the experience of nature, the unmediated access to its wilderness.</p>
      <p>There's a funny tension when this wilderness is cultivated in machinated landscapes. It's almost smart. But it doesn't acknowledge that nature described is always tamed, and that the describer is never innocent. 'Authenticity' kills the drama. It misses how being ecological has to include your perspective.</p>

      <p>Nature as wild and untamed, in opposition to human artifice, and most importantly, way bigger and sublime. This view feels like it deifies nature but negates humans, as if we're not a part of it, only through being blown away by it.</p>
      <p>Part of this echoes in romantic writing, but when done well this would not fall under Morton's Authentic Style. And even when done well, there is a risk of falling into the Religious Style.</p>
      <p>Sublime nature may suddenly elevate your experience so much that you start looking down on the fallible and godless creatures that are your fellow humans. Misanthropocentrism, Morton calls it.</p>

      <h2>Cultured Nature</h2>
      <p>Growing up in the Netherlands may have made me default to a view of nature as something made, or at least 'kept'. The human in the role of the steward, taking care of nature as of a garden the size of the planet. I'm not sure again, it feels hierarchical, too comfortable to assume the position of the one giving rather than needing care.</p>
      <p>Here we find an ecology in Morton's Immersive Style. Nature as a thing to surround ourselves with, still presumes that we aren't already.</p>
      <p>Morton notes how many ways of talking about the environment seem anchored in the idea of a settlement or house. This fixed location is from where nature seems to happen 'around'. Think 'surroundings', 'en-viron', 'ambi-ence'. There may be care but no trust</p>

    <h1>Styles of Relating</h1>
    <p>A collection of ways of understanding what 'nature' means. It is based on views of nature that have been popular in Western culture. It also aligns very closely with Timothy Morton's distinction of different styles of thinking about ecology.</p>
    <p>An Immersive Style pictures an 'environment' around but outside oneself. An Authentic style aims for unmediated experience, but forgets the gaze. A Religious style acknowledges how things are complicit, but not itself. An Efficient style aims for smooth operations but forgets what is smoothened out.</p>
    <p>I'm looking for a way or style of thinking 'nature' that starts from acknowledging how we are intertwined, but that still leaves space for humans (because I am one).</p>

      <p>A falling in love that ends tragically with the destructive stalking of an undeath lover. It's a memory, but that is why it distances from the now.</p>

      <h2>Shit</h2>
      <p>Giving your plants their vitamin dose, the minerals they need to grow. It seems a classic caretaking gesture. The problem is not in the fertilising (at least when done organically).</p>
      <p>You can only fertilise what is otherwise infertile. And things aren't so much infertile as made infertile, depleted. Usually it seems there would be a 'natural circle of life' that would enrich the soil with the recomposed corpses of the past generation.</p>
      <p>Shit. Also in that shape. So yes fertiliser cares but by creating the conditions for isolation.</p>

      <p>Maybe it's true that caring means killing (losely to Donna Haraway), but even or especially then it's about killing well.</p>
      <p>Bio Kill seems an easy enemy, but it is apparently specifically focused, on ants. Does that make it different from weeding?</p>
      <p>Yes, where some plants-made-weeds may actually compete with other 'wanted' plants, ants don't. The Bio Kill approach seems to be more about isolating a plant from ecology.</p>

      <p>Even though soil seems to form a continuous substance with the rest of Earth, spades can puncture it and make it manipulable. Like a mini mine. Digging as the condition for taking out (and putting in).</p>
      <p>Still, the intention is always that the roots will puncture the walls of division the spade created. A temporary chasm, break. Almost a challenge, if it wasn't for the other motivation of just changing the location.</p>

      <h3>a meme and essay on post-growth futures</h3>
      <h5>A critical reflection on the post-growth scenarios developed by a think tank on human-technology-nature relations from <a href="https://stt.nl/nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stichting Toekomstbeeld der Techniek</a>. Slightly adapted from the version published in the book "Voor niets gaat de zon op" by Lisa Mandemaker and Daphne Roodhuyzen (2024).</h5>
      <img src="/images/futures/finalcompass.jpg" class=""/>

      <h1>Navigating knotted timelines</h1>
      <p>It's not just institutes that speculate on the future of human-nature relations and the implications of emerging technologies. For many internet users it's a favourite pastime, perhaps born from a similar necessity to imagine alternatives to a prolonged present of technology-powered ecosystem collapse. Imagine that you could look into a <a href="https://thevoroscope.com/2015/12/28/on-examining-preposterous-futures/" target="_blank">futures cone</a> like a spyglass, and see a whole range of vignettes of
      possible and even preferable futures.</p>

      <h2>A compass for the future</h2>
      <p>The Future Compass is a type of meme where three internet phenomena come together: the Political Compass, <em>edeologies</em>, and visual-first future speculation. It pictures a grid of 16 different futures, ordered along two axes like Centralization-Atomization or Synthetic-Organic. This structure echoes the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Political Compass</a>, a grid that enables you to plot your political position on both a left-right and an authoritarian-libertarian axis. The Future Compass builds upon this predecessor by literally drawing out the implications of certain political positions on the world, in 16 squares.</p>
      <img src="/images/futures/futurecompass.jpg" class=""/>      
      <h5>Example of a Future Compass meme</h5>
      <p>Its aesthetics seem borrowed from video games and make it feel like a menu to Choose Your World to play. Each of these futures mix ideological, technological, geographical and pop-cultural references to suggest whole worlds with only a tiny image and title. The titles are reminiscent of the fringe '<a href="https://joshuacitarella.substack.com/p/e-deologies-v-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">edeologies</a>' that young internet subcultures use to identify themselves by remixing ideological pre- and suffixes.<sup>1</sup> Think 'Cringe Solarpunk NEET Statism', or 'Liberal Pluralist Blue Church Imperium Eusociality'. Such niche worlds allow their creators to materialise their anxieties and hopes of the future in the style of internet fiction movements like cyberpunk and solarpunk, thereby offering their audiences a way to identify and navigate their dystopias and utopias.</p>
      <p>At least, that seems to be the seduction of the Future Compass. When I look at one I feel like gaining some grip on how different politics may turn into different worlds, enabling me to root for the one that leads to my preferred future. But they come with limits familiar to future speculation. So when I was asked to shed a critical light on the future scenarios of the <a href="https://stt.nl/nl/toekomstverkenningen/de-toekomstige-verhouding-tussen-mens-natuur-en-technologie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">think tank</a>, I decided to use the Future Compass as an exaggerated lens to reflect on the seductions and limits of each scenario.</p>

      <h2>Critical knots</h2>
      <p>I was inspired by Joanna Pope's critical appropriation of the Future Compass.<sup>2</sup> She wanted to use it for forging political alliances on the left, but had to overcome some challenges. The most important one for now is how the grid layout offers the illusion of a selection of separate self-contained timelines. This obscures how futures are complex and ambiguous; how certain scenarios may imply each other spatially – existing at the same time in different places – or temporally – leading into one another. </p>

      <p>Pope brings in the decolonial distinction of centre-periphery. Future speculation, especially the utopian kind, often focuses on the implications on areas where techno-social developments are used and consumed (the centre). This tends to sideline the conditions that make those worlds possible (periphery), including material resources, production networks, and waste management. Imperial metropoles relied on their colonies, just like consumption economies entail off-shore extraction and exploitation. Writer Elvia Wilk highlights that many speculative stories hinge on how "the corporate techno utopian aesthetic fantasy is one that depends on its counterpart, its tragic, dirty, hellish opposite"<sup>3</sup>.  So in a Future Compass, two squares on opposite corners may just be two different places in the same future world.</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean that life in the ‘centre’ is uniform. In the second think tank session, when elaborating on the scenarios, I was in a group focused on the <a href="#power" class="tag">Central Command Centre</a> scenario. We discussed how a second order effect could be the emergence of an underground cyberpunk scene. The ways that technologies are adopted often mirror this cultural distinction between mainstream and subculture, or even counterculture. For instance, the scenario of <a href="#wonder" class="tag">New Genesis</a> could both manifest in 'resurrection-entrepreneurs' bringing spectacular species back to life (mainstream) and in NGOs that genetically modify organisms to feed on pollution (subculture).</p>

      <h2>The Post-Growth Compass</h2>
      <p>As a critical reflection on the think tank scenarios, I wanted to appropriate the Future Compass format by including some of the knots that exist between possible futures. I'm quite a fan of the world-building power of the captioned images in the compass, but how to shine a light on their shadows and entanglements?</p>
      <p>First I tried to complexify the future imagined for each of the five scenarios, by teasing out aspects that are less explicit or hidden in them. I identified a central 'dramatic' value that would allow for a narrative to spin around, like ‘<a href="#purity" class="tag">purity</a>’ and ‘<a href="#fertility" class="tag">fertility</a>’. Based on this value, I speculated on one countercultural version of each scenario, and one periphery-scenario focused on the infrastructure that would make the scenario possible. This resulted in 15 sub-scenarios that could be your post-growth future. </p>

        <p>To make the entanglements between the futures explicit, the legend reveals how different sub-scenarios are part of the same World. Get one, and you get the others with it. So if you would land on a 'centre' scenario, it may raise critical questions on its inherent limits. Or if you find a home in a periphery or counterculture scenario, it may expose the blind spots of its radicals. Does the counterculture not rely on the same peripheral conditions of say, <a href="#solidarity" class="tag">interspecies AI</a>? Does a focus on the local leave a <a href="#power" class="tag">power vacuum</a> for geopolitical institutions to take charge?</p>

      <h1>Plant Care and Power Tools</h1>

      <p>There was mould on the soil of my plants. The other day I had given them nubs of plant food, to get growing, but now those efforts seemed in vain. Luckily it was pretty easy to scoop out the mouldy layer from the soil, like peeling film from a jam. At least the visible parts. It felt good to take care of my plants, to protect them. But when I googled for the cause, I read that the mould wasn’t a problem. That actually, it allows the nutrients to travel to my plants. The mould wasn't competing, it was taking care. I wasn't taking care, I was blocking it.</p>
      <p>It’s one of many interactions with my plants where I realised I had to deal with an inherited modernist idea of what it means to care. A masculine one too. A protective 'I got this, let me handle it' attitude. In trying to care for my plants, I assumed a role based on control. Control of their growth, the organisms they interacted with, their sad moments – and then I cut off an old leaf.</p>
      <p>I recognise my attitude in responses to ecological crises. Geo-engineering, green tech and eco-design are here to fix it for us. And I’ve started to distrust this control paradigm. Not just because it's based on a power hierarchy that strips the care recipient of agency and keeps them dependent. It also just fails. It assumes the knowability of the world, so it can intervene in the best way. And then I scoop out the mould and kill my plant.</p>
      <p>In teaching, collaborating, making, I learn ways to hush my inner control freak. Ways of caring that respect and even support the agency of the other, instead of overruling it. Timothy Morton talks about a 'care less' attitude<sup>1</sup>, but in a way that I interpret as meaning something like 'trust more'. I want to get to this mode when relating to plants. Not just care, but care based on trust rather than control.</p>

      <h2>The Tool Garden</h2>
      <p>Crossing the dimensions of care and control creates a nice garden plan for my online gijs.garden. Four corners, four ways of relating to plants. In the garden tour that is this essay, each of the corners plays a narrative role. Starting from the clear dystopia of controlling but not caring relations, to the more hidden dystopia of caring but controlling relations (think me and the mould); then to the unlikely ally of a romantic but distant relation, and towards the utopian caring and trusting corner.</p>

      <img src="/images/powertools/compass.png" class="" style="width:100%;"/>
      <h5>A map of the garden</h5>

      <p>Care relations never grow by themselves. When you peek into each corner, you can make out a small ecosystem of things – from logos to garden plans to tools for plantcare. On gijs.garden I gather instances of material culture that I see as Care Tools: things that not only reflect but also structure our relations with plants. When I use a particular Tool – like a Rake or a Pot – it casts the plant in a certain way, and gives me a certain role. So how do the things around us condition the kind of plant-relations that may grow, as a kind of synthetic soil?</p>
      <p>I plant these Tools in my garden based on how much they seem to invite humans and plants to interact (neglect-care axis), and on the agency granted to the plant (trust-control axis). Let me now take you on a tour through each corner. We’ll find different types of Care Tools and see what they may teach us about creating conditions for trustful care, where plants and moulds and humans alike may flourish.</p>

      <h2>I. Rakes and Weeds</h2>
      <p>How to have plants in a modernist house? In a place all about light and space, where to leave dirt and brown leaves? For the 1930 Villa Tugendhat, Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich had a solution. The modernist marvel got a designated space for plants. Next to one of the outer glass walls they added a second wall, which cleared space in-between to house a <a class="tag" href="#wintergarden"><em>Winter Garden</em></a>. Humans could remain unbothered, while plants live inside a sort of widened double-glass window. I wonder if you could still smell them. In winter, the tropical plants frame the barren trees outside like a filter on a lens.</p>
      <img src="images/powertools/winter.jpg" alt="">
      <h5>The winter garden of Villa Tugendhat with a Rake</h5>

      <p>Here in the dystopian corner of gijs.garden it feels a bit like at the Tugendhats. There is a <a class="tag" href="#golf">golf course</a>, an icon of a <a class="tag" href="#holdglobecard">wired globe</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#doormat">doormat</a>. A <a class="tag" href="#battlefield">Blue Marble</a>, some pulled weeds, a roll of <a class="tag" href="#lawn">astroturf</a> and a green bin. A can of <a class="tag" href="#pesticide">insecticides</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#functional">vertical farm</a>, vitamin pills and a <a class="tag" href="#weedtorch">gas-fueled weed-burning torch</a>.</p>
      <p>Look at the golf course lawn! A flawless field rolled out even over desert sands; an augmented reality mat for sunny games and covert meetings. Like in <a class="tag" href="#tele">Teletubbies</a>, nature is a set, a virtual backdrop for soft drama to play out. The rolling slopes have to be as spotless as a greenscreen, or else they would foreground themselves, breaking the illusion that the set is not living.</p>
      <p>A Rake, like a doormat, produces a distinction between dirt and clean. It draws the old leaves and young weeds out from the plants and flowers that were planned, planted. It may look like Rakes practice care, but as long as planned plants are proxies for something we humans want, like a nice view or free veggies, it’s selfcare in disguise. Rakes – the logic of Tools in this corner – draw boundaries between organisms for our use and organisms outside of that. They make some plants resource and others weeds. Meanwhile they cast humans as rakers, the emperor who decides. But in either option, plants are objects: part of the earth that doesn't need to be saved on Noah's arc, that wouldn't think nor feel, that just create the conditions for us and all other animals to shine.</p>
      <p>The logical endgame of this way of relating is something like a <em>Global Farm</em>, where natural elements are optimised to produce what humans need. A cooler climate? An engineering problem. Calming beauty? Served by a thin slice of plants in front of the window. Why does this feel off?</p>
      <p>When three astronauts went on what would be the last manned trip to the moon, some 50 years ago, they looked back at their home planet and took three photos with their on-board Hasselblad. One would become famous all over the planet they were looking at: The <a class="tag" href="#battlefield">Blue Marble</a>. It was an emancipatory image, centering Africa and removing all meridians and borders shown on usual representations of the globe. </p>
      <p>But the image feels different now. Maybe it's because first the Eames couple and then Google Maps smoothened the conceptual leaps from seeing the whole globe to navigating to the nearest coffee shop. Timothy Morton (2018) explains how such felt “quantum jumps” serve to guard different ways of worlding<sup>1</sup>. The Marble and the forest don't map onto each other easily. It’s why the green hues over the continent of Africa didn’t feel like plants. Until you could see how familiar textures of clouds, waters, algae, fractally scale up and seamlessly lift you from how those waves feel, sound, smell, and shake you.</p>
      <p>Blue Marble puts me in <a class="tag" href="#god">God-mode</a>. Presented with the issue in front of me – say, a conflict between economy and ecology – it makes me think of how to organise things better. The Rake Tools of this garden corner keep plants at a shaft-length distance, but without leaving them much room to do as they please. Power Tools. Plants are kept in check so tightly they might as well be a render, or removed so far that their only trace is visual.</p>
      <p>This place is an ‘easy dystopia’ because life held still is not alive. It answers perverse desires for cleanliness and control, but even a pure modernist me would feel uneasy staying here for too long, Let's visit the corner where this conflict is resolved in a way to live with plants without getting our hands too dirty.</p>

      <h2>II. Taming Pots</h2>
      <p>One of the most iconic Victorian gardens is located near Victoria, Canada. Jennie and Robert Butchart came to these hills to produce cement in 1904, but when the limestone quarry was exhausted 21 years later, they were left with an ugly pit. How to turn a bleak post-industrial society green? Jennie envisioned a paradise: she had horses cart in top soil, gathered plants and grew it all into the <a class="tag" href="#victorian"><em>Sunken Garden</em></a>.</p>
      <img src="images/powertools/sunken.jpg" alt="">
      <h5>The Sunken Garden of the Butchart Gardens with a Pot</h5>
      <p>It's spectacular in a way that doesn't resolve quite easily where to locate the wonder. With 151 blooming flower beds it's a lush landscape, an amalgamation of insect seduction in intense colours and shapes. An idyllic, utopian, dream-like place. Still, the hand of the author is never hidden. It's almost too visible to immerse myself, to really enter the myth. The borders of flowerbeds, paths, trees and fields are just so clear-cut. There is an honesty to this artificiality, a vulnerability to the idealised expression of flowered hills. It's not pretending to be nature proper, and not pretending not to want admiration for how well carved and kept. For how strong the grip, the mastery. Let 65 thousand flowers bloom, and <a href="https://butchartgardens.com/whats-in-bloom-now-garden-updates-june-10-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fifty gardeners</a> sweat.</p>
      <p>The high care high control garden corner is like the Sunken Garden: clean, but very green. Here we see a <a class="tag" href="#plantloft">monstera</a>, <a class="tag" href="#fertilizer">fertiliser</a>, and a picket fence. There is a <a class="tag" href="#aesthetic">tulip</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#persian">Persian carpet</a>, and a <a class="tag" href="#victorian">peacock made from flowers</a>. A supermarket <a class="tag" href="#basil">basil plant</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#handcard">hand holding a sprout</a>, some <a class="tag" href="#plantclip">tie-wraps</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#bonsai">bonsai</a>, and an artwork with <a class="tag" href="#artplant">electrodes pinched on a leaf</a>.</p>
      <p>There's a saying sometimes attributed to Descartes: 'God created the Earth but the Dutch created Holland'. Building dikes and draining polders came with a way of relating to nature as a 'cultivated landscape'. As someone born on this soil, I grew up with the Anthropocenic condition that Man mingled with the Earth as a given. One consequence often drawn from facing the Anthropocene is responsibility: we spoiled it, now we should fix it. If everything is touched by humans, if there is no outside to our sphere of influence, if everything is a garden, we better be a good gardener.</p>
      <p>A Tool that invites both care and control is like a Pot; it makes a plant manageable, tame. <a class="tag" href="#pot">Plant pots</a> were ancient ways to transport species, but they carried in them the idea that a plant is an individual. This allows for a new living arrangement where humans and plants coexist in the same house. Humans provide rain and food, plants peace and optics. Something lush in the organic shapes of the plants contrasting the clean lines of the new floor and old windows. Something juicy in the green of the leaves melting with the white of the walls into a softer shade.</p>
      <p>Rather than a Global Farm, the final <em>telos</em> of Pot Tools is Planet Garden. Human and technology fuse in the role of a gardener, tending and taking care of Nature. This requires lots of monitoring, and lots of maintenance. Toxins and invasive exotics back to where they came from. Healthy and harmonious ecosystems in. Part of me is susceptible to this mode. It feels like taking long due responsibility. After centuries of wreckless tool-swinging, now justice reigns from above, so we better put those tools to use for reparative ends.</p>
      <p>The dystopia here is hidden in the paternalistic role baked into this mingling. Unlike in the Winter Garden, humans and plants intertwine, but they don't intertwine evenly. Humans as gardeners make sure plants flourish and protect them from all that may hurt them, but within the borders of their beds and Pots. When geo-engineers care for our geo, they also perpetuate a hierarchy that strokes our ego. Pots are Power Tools too. See, where are the weeds in the Sunken Garden? The mushrooms, the yellow leaves? Do all these plants even <em>want</em> to grow here?</p>

      <h2>III. Wilding Windows</h2>
      <p>Construction sites often turn into unintended scenes of urban rewilding. Between concrete slabs and drainage pipes: a blossoming bouquet of plants usually considered weeds. This was the model and aesthetic for <a class="tag" href="#hni"><em>The New Garden</em></a> of the Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam. As far as design goes, Hans Engelbrecht and Frank Bruggeman introduced some building materials and sand heaps in 2015, and plants did the rest. In a few years time, the garden was filled with a wild range of plants.</p>

      <img src="images/powertools/newgarden.jpg" alt="">
      <h5>The New Garden of Nieuwe Instituut with a Window</h5>

      <p>The low care low control corner here feels like the New Garden: a bit unkept. There is an <a class="tag" href="#ruins">overgrown shed</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#wilderness">landscape paintin</a>, an <a class="tag" href="#analog">analog camera</a>. Many <a class="tag" href="#wildflower">wildflowers</a> and some nettles in between. There's a smelly pond with an <a class="tag" href="#orchid">orchid</a>, botanical drawings, a green-roofed <a class="tag" href="#shire">Hobbit house</a>. There's a <a class="tag" href="#nihilismcard">whatever-emoji</a> as well, a photo of <a class="tag" href="#lover">earth 'rising'</a> from the moon, there's a <a class="tag" href="#rose">thorny red rose</a>.</p>
      <p>From the painter of the <a class="tag" href="#wilderness"><em>Wanderer above a Sea of Fog</em></a>, here we see Caspar David Friedrich's 1825 view of the <em>Ruined Monastery of Eldena</em>.</p>

      <img src="images/powertools/friedrich.jpg" alt="">

      <p>In the romantic end of it all, plants grow over houses until it's hard to say where rock ends and brick begins. There's still a little shed in the painting. Like a new sprout, it emphasises both the age and size of its elder. The monastery fell under the weight of wilderness, and a wanderer found a home. The house is not very well-kept, nor are the plants. But they do grow freely. Wilderness undoes the idea of weeds anyway.</p>
      <p>Rather than being tamed, plants in this corner are all made wild. Tools that push us here work like a <a class="tag" href="#window">Window</a>. They frame a <em>view</em>, like a landscape painting. The framing gaze feels almost as present in the paint as the famous <em>rückenfigur</em> of the Wanderer. It's probably not surprising when you hear that Friedrich added much of the greenery according to taste. He thought that "a painting must stand as a painting, made by human hand, not seek to disguise itself as Nature". Through a Window, desires colour our view, plants go wild, and our breath turns dew.</p>
      <p>Even in this nostalgic vision there's a future baked in. Follow the longing and we get to <em>Holocenic Park</em>. Walled off reserves keep wilderness as was, effectively fencing off humans in <a class="tag" href="#purity">urban zoos</a>, powered by vertical farming and other forms of nature instrumentalized to the extent that they don’t jump the fence. The Wild can only exist in a pure form if we humans live in a place that is not just tame, but also reified as purely cultural. Across the street from the New Garden is Huis Sonneveld, another modernist architectural marvel, with a great view of the garden but no plants behind the Window.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it's necessary to fall in love. But Window tech remains an Unlikely Ally. Unlikely, because in this corner there is attention but not much care. Plants just do their thing. It's refreshing for modernist me. Windows are allies, because they invite a mode of relating that is attuned to plants. Daydreams of immersion, kept in check by a wish to long. Just to taste the tease of what Joanna Macy calls the "erotic affirmation of the world of phenomena"<sup>2</sup>. I feel their majesty, and yes, fall in love. But it's not enough. It even feels easy, avoidant, privileged.</p>
      <p>An analog photo suggests a temporal distance that allows for longing to arise, but I don’t want to trade proximity for trust. Window Tools purify, just like Rakes, but rather than disposing of nature, Windows wash the lurker away in its overwhelming power. To be overgrown and turned green. But the real hierarchy is hidden: it’s salvation at the expense of objectification. Perversions are fine but when eroticism turns to exoticism, when I <em>other</em> the world to escape in it, pleasure becomes consumptive. Plants as stalked-on projection screens for fantasies from behind a foggy Window.</p>
      <p>The overgrowing New Garden grew less inviting to the general public and more to illicit encounters between those who dwell well in the shadows. Reason enough for the municipality to start weeding out. The garden has since been redesigned. A care relation ceases to be a relation when it dismisses either its plant or its human. Tempting, but with an escape into the wild I get off the hook too easily. How to care while caring less?</p>

      <h2>IV. Front Swamps</h2>
      <p>High care low control. What does that mean? The theory is clear: an ecological view of plants does not see them as separate from humans, but intertwined kin, entangled in a molecular cycle where one breathes in what the other breathes out, to infinity. Trustful care then transcends the division between figure and ground. Not a caring-for as if we’re separate, but a caring-with where its subject and object fuse. When we take care of ourselves, we care for our lifeworld, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>Sure, but how to <em>feel</em> that way? <em>Live</em> like it? Now it’s just a wordy caption to a still growing artwork. It’s slippery: let the plant just grow and I’m back in the New Garden evading myself. Prune it clean and I have followed my will to power back to the Sunken Garden. We need material conditions that implicate the human in a care ecology. The engagement of Pot Tools, but with the wonder of Window tech.

      <p>Enter the mystery garden corner, where uneasy crossbreds light the way. It’s still a muddy mess, but there are some early bloomers. A <a class="tag" href="#monobloc">plastic chair</a> on a veranda, a Hockney painting of a <a class="tag" href="#hockney">jungle-garden</a>, an icon of hands held underneath <a class="tag" href="#floatplantcard">a floating branch</a>. A <a class="tag" href="#plantstick">bamboo-shaped trellis</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#rhizome">rhizome diagram</a>, a <a class="tag" href="#self">selfie from space</a>. There's a hot smelly <a class="tag" href="#composter">compost container</a>, <a class="tag" href="#babylon">Babylonian Hanging Gardens</a>. A <a class="tag" href="#fruitface">portrait composed of fruits</a>, a theory on <a class="tag" href="#solidarity">degrowth</a>, white <a class="tag" href="#zollverein">birches in a coal mine</a>.</p>
      <p>A <a class="tag" href="#frontgarden">Front Garden</a> is a strange zone between inside and outside, public and private. Many Dutch neighbourhoods feature them, perhaps as green buffers to compensate for the usually see-through terraced houses. Their compositions are as varied as the interiors, from patches of grass to tiled makeshift bike parkings to little Versailles. But don't get fooled to think they are frontal backyards. Front gardens are house garments. They dress our homes, and through it, our dire reputations. We're implicated, we have skin in the soil.</p>

      <h5>A typical Dutch front garden with a Trellis</h5>

      <p>Let’s take this Front Garden human-plant arrangement as a Tool prototype. In the subtle move of placing a <a class="tag" href="#wintergarden">Winter Garden</a> on the other side of the wall, it starts to frame not the outside but the inside. Any Front Garden care is not disinterested altruistic planet-care, it's spoiled with selfcare. It can still be left rather wild, but unlike the public <a class="tag" href="#hni">New Garden</a>, its wilderness is bound by the projected thoughts of the postman who has to pass through. Even a wild look is a look. So it organises vanity to work for plants. True, that also invites control, Raking the yard clean between blooming flower beds. Still, the need to manipulate this piece of land is loosened by the fact that it is outside. Unlike a Pot, a Front Garden organises plants in a space where they go with the flow of the environment, make mystery root connections and have mouldy encounters.</p>
      <p>Arcadia was a land where humans and non-humans lived harmoniously. That's the myth. I like to believe that a spirited Avatar-world is the endgame of Front Garden care mode. Yet I should hold back nostalgic visions of going 'back to the land'. Elvia Wilk writes how “there are toxic materials in the soil and the air – corporations and governments have put them there – and this is now the baseline (...) there is nothing to go "back" to.”<sup>3</sup> How to fall in love with an intoxicated earth? A taste of, what Britney Spears calls, <a href="https://youtu.be/LOZuxwVk7TU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Poison Paradise</em></a>. Sure, one's toxin is another’s food: their CO<sup>2</sup>, our O<sup>2</sup>. But only well-dosed toxicity is intoxicating, a good bitter.</p>
      <p>Unlike in Holocenic Park, I can’t be innocent in <a class="tag" href="#solidarity">Poison Paradise</a>. The way through petro-modernist traces leads from biting the apple towards loving the mould, the dirt, the rot. As much as I want to let it all grow, utopia requires dosing this uncanny. Caring well means killing well.<sup>4</sup> Trustful care takes shape not as dominating or pleasing, but expressing and answering desires like dance moves. To live with the toxic swamp, Care Tools need to do more than help eradicate it, tidy it or just look at it. Front Garden Tools need to organise a space to negotiate desires. Trellises for play, challenge and cohabitation. Only through mouldy encounters, by getting dirty and flirty, we can get to the kimchi, the tempeh and the wine.</p>

      <h2>Towards taste</h2>
      <p>We've come to the end of our tour. We learned about the importance of proximity from the distant <a class="tag" href="#wintergarden">Winter Garden</a>, commitment from the <a class="tag" href="#victorian">Sunken Garden</a>, trust from the <a class="tag" href="#hni">New Garden</a>, and positionality from the <a class="tag" href="#frontgarden">Front Garden</a>. How to get to hot swamp flirts? I’m learning.</p>

      <p>In urban Rotterdam, I don’t have the luxury of a front garden. However, it is allowed to lift some tiles for a facade garden. We made one in front of the studio. The plants catch lots of stray plastic that we keep picking out. I wanted a climber around the studio entrance, but despite regular watering the wisteria died. The soil quality was prime suspect. We tried jasmine and I tried to care less. It seemed to grow resilient; tough love answered by fragrant flowers. Tough as the newgrown leaves of the supermarket <a class="tag" href="#basil">basil plant</a>. We don’t know what those had sucked up from the soil, but when studiomate Jack mixed them in with lemon and avocado for a pasta, it smelled like pastry and tasted quite like paradise.</p>
